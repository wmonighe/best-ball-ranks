# AGENTS.md

## Code Style
- Follow our existing coding style (PEP8). Use Black for formatting Python code.
- Avoid abbreviations in variable names for clarity.

## Testing
- Always run `npm test` (Jest suite) before proposing changes.
- Ensure all tests pass and ESLint shows no errors. Do not share a Pull Request until you are confident that all Conflicts have been resolved

## Project Conventions
- Use our utility functions in `utils/` rather than external libraries when possible.
- If adding a new dependency, update `requirements.txt` and `README.md`.

## Pull Request Guidelines
- Prefix branch names with issue number (e.g., `123-feature-name`).
- PR description must include a summary of changes and any assumptions.
