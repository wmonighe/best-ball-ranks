# Best Ball Ranks

This project displays wmonighe's Best Ball Eliminator rankings. Rankings are stored in a public Google Sheet and loaded via the `gviz` CSV export. The page also shows sentiment values scraped from taeks.com.

## Setup

1. Publish the Google Sheet to the web so the CSV endpoint can be accessed publicly.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser to view the table.

## Development

Run `npm test` to execute the Jest suite (if configured). ESLint should pass with no errors.
