# Best Ball Rankings

This project displays Best Ball Eliminator rankings sourced from a Google Sheet. The sheet must be published to the web so the CSV can be fetched from the `gviz` endpoint. Sentiment data is scraped from [taeks.com](https://taeks.com/nfl/bestball/leaderboard/rookie) and shown alongside each player.
