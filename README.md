This project displays Best Ball Eliminator rankings sourced from a Google Sheet. The sheet must be published to the web so the CSV can be fetched from the `gviz` endpoint. Sentiment data is scraped from [taeks.com](https://taeks.com/nfl/bestball/leaderboard/rookie) and shown alongside each player.

This project displays my Best Ball Eliminator rankings using a simple HTML
page. Rankings are loaded from a Google Sheet via its `gviz` CSV export.
For the URL to work the sheet must be **published to the web** so the CSV
endpoint is publicly accessible.

A "Sentiment" column is added by scraping data from
[taeks.com](https://taeks.com/nfl/bestball/leaderboard/rookie). Network
restrictions or crossâ€‘origin policies may prevent this data from loading
successfully when the page is hosted elsewhere.
